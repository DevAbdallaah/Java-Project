MY CALCULATOR 

This calculator is built in java. It has two sets of buttons which are the number buttons and the function or operation button and also has a text field on the top of the frame which it displays what the user is doing. 
The number buttons are from 0 to 9, so pressing on any of the buttons, it will display the number pressed in the text field.
The function buttons are ten in numbers, which are clear button, negative button, modulo button, division button, multiplication button, subtraction button, addition button, delete button, dot button and Equal to button.
The clear button clear everything in the text field. The negative button convert positive number to negative and vice versa. The division button divides the second number by the first number. The multiplication, subtraction and addition buttons do their conventional function.
The modula button displays the remainder. We have to take note of this button because it only works with integers.
